I will follow him
Follow him wherever he may go
And near him, I always will be
For nothing can keep me away
He is my destiny
I will follow him
Ever since he touched my heart I knew
There isn't an ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away
Away from his love
I love him!
I love him!
I love him!
And where he goes
I'll follow!
I'll follow!
I'll follow!
I will follow him
Follow him wherever he may go
There isn't an ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away
I will follow him (follow him)
Follow him wherever
He may go! (uhh uhh uhh)
There isn't an ocean
Too deep (too deep!)
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away!
Away from his love!
Oh oh yeah!
(I love him!)
Oh yes, I love him
(I'll follow!)
I'm gonna follow
(True love!)
He'll always be my true love
(Forever!)
From now until forever
I love him!
I love him!
I love him!
And where he goes
I'll follow!
I'll follow!
I'll follow!
He'll always be my true love
(My true love! My true love!)
From now until forever!
(Forever, forever)
There isn't an ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away!!
Away from his love
I will follow him (follow him)
Follow him wherever
He may go! (uhh uhh uhh)
There isn't an ocean
Too deep (too deep!)
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away!
Away from his love!
Oh oh yeah!
